/**
 * Shared header builder for authenticated fetch calls.

 * `/api/skill-artifacts/*` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` because

 * `useChat` and `copilot-stream` already attach this manually; the artifact
 * preview / download / HEAD call sites use this helper to stay consistent.
 *
 * Memory-only on purpose — token is held in `localStorage` by `authStore`
 * (see `src/stores/authStore.ts`). If the store ever moves to httpOnly
 * cookies, swap the implementation here.
